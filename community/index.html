<blockquote>
<p>Women Developers and Programmers! Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don&rsquo;t be shy. Develop it.</p>

<p>It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today&rsquo;s budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn&rsquo;t a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask &ldquo;stupid questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment.</p>
