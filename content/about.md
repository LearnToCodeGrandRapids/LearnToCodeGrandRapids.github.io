### History

In December of 2014 Theo Voss created the Learn to Code Grand Rapids group to help people interested in coding figure out what to learn and to explain coding terminology. Meetups consisted of a mix of presentations, workshops, and recommendations on other Meetups happening each month.

Jeffrey Fuller took over the group in September of 2016. His combination of industry experience, and love of learning made him a natural choice. While the group continued to focus on its mission, a new emphasis on professional development was added.
