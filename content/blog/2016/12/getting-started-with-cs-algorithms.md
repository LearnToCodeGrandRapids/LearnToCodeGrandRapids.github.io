Below are my notes for the December 2016 meetup where we go over the basics of problem solving and implementing algorithms in C#.

In this session we talk about implementing algorithms and a problem solving strategy.

## Problem Solving

While working a problem, it is import to remember to keep your spirits up. This is especially important, no matter how experienced you are. 

### Steps

* Understand the problem
* Solve the problem manually
    * Break the problem down into easily solvable parts
    * Look for familiar patterns
* Write down the manual steps to solve the problem
* Convert the manual steps to code 
    * Breaking down the problem
    * Experiment

#### Understand the Problem

As you build your coding skillset you will become more comfortable writing code, and it will become increasingly tempting to jump right into writing code when you are working on a problem. This is almost always a mistake, because you will be proceeding based on assumptions rather than undertsanding the problem domain.

The two things you can do to help understand a problem are to **reread** the problem, and to the **restate** the problem. I recommend reading a problem carefully at least twice to ensure that all details sink in. This should be followed up by restating the problem to demonstrate your understanding. The best way to do this is to explain the problem to another person.

#### Solve the Problem Mannually

#### Write Down the Manual Steps to Solve the Problem

#### Convert the Manual Steps to Code

## Additional Resources

One of the better resources available to help develop your creative problem solving skills is the book, "(Think Like a Programmer)[https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246]." Each chapter in the book tackles a specific programming concept and excercises are included so you can apply your knowledge.
