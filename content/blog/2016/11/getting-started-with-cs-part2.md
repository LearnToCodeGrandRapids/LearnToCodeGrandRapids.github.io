Below are my notes for the November 2016 meetup where we go over the basics of C# and work through some sample problems. We highly recommend that you [watch the video series](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners/) associated with this material since it is far more complete.

## Programming Problems

### Elementary

* Write a program that asks the user for her name and greets her with her name.

* Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

* Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n

### Lists

* Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.

* Write a function that concatenates two lists.

* Write a function that takes an integer and returns a list of its digits.

* Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.

* Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. For example the list `["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"]` gets printed as:

```
*********

* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
