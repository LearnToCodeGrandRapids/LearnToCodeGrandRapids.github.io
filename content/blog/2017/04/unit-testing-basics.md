In this month's meetup we started working through the [string calculator](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) kata. We completed the first few steps, and finished after completing "support different delimiters."

You can download the solution from our github repo [string-calculator-part1](https://github.com/LearnToCodeGrandRapids/string-calculator-part1). Just follow the link, click on "clone or download," and then click "download zip."

### Update 2017-05-11
