During our unit testing workshop there was some confusion over which modules should be installed using the super customizable Visual Studio 2017 installer. In the past Visual Studio installers would give you the ability to do a little customization, but you always ended up with more than you needed. With Visual Studio 2017, if you don't know what you need you might not end up with enough to actually do anything.

The first thing you want to do is read Microsoft's [install Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio) article. This short document has links for the different versions of Visual Studio. If you are just learning, or using Visual Studio for non-commercial use, you probably want the _community_ edition.
