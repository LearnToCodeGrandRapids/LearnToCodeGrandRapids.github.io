We pivoted this month. Originally, we were going to talk about introductory programming concepts in JavaScript, but our audience was already past that point so we decided to work on something else. We decided to do a brief demo that showed how to do basic dom manipulation using jQuery. We created a basic interface that would visualize the occupancy of seats on an airplane.
